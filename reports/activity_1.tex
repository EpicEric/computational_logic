% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex




% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig



% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\IEEEPARstart{E}{sse} exercício programa tem como objetivo determinar o fecho
transitivo e reflexivo de uma relação dada. O fecho transitivo e reflexivo de
uma relação é o menor conjunto tal que sua união com a relação resulta em uma 
relação transitiva e reflexiva. Usaremos a linguagem de programação
Elixir para seu desenvolvimento.

A linguagem de programação Elixir é uma linguagem de propósito geral funcional,
dinâmica e que roda na máquina virtual Erlang. Com Elixir, é possível criar aplicações
tolerante a falhas e distribuídas. Nesse projeto, usamos o ferramenta Mix,
que facilita a criação, gerenciamento e teste de projetos escritos em Elixir.
A linguagem tem preocupação especial com a documentação do código.
Existem nativamente funções de acesso e geração de documentação e os exemplos são
testados tais como o código, a fim de evitar inconsistência.

Ao longo deste projeto, usaremos recursos da linguagem como \textit{pattern mathing}
e recursão. \textit{Pattern mathing} é um mecanismo para extrair valores de uma estrutura
de dados que satisfaçam um padrão. Recursão -- no contexto de programação -- é o processo
de usar uma função para definir a si própria.


\section{Desenvolvimento}
Para este projeto, decidimos evitar o uso de quaisquer funções da biblioteca
padrão do Elixir. Alternativamente, como será apresentado na seção ``Algoritmo'',
optamos por manualmente desenvolver funções auxiliares pelos princípios de
recursão e \textit{pattern matching}.

\subsubsection{Modelagem}
Criamos o nosso módulo do Elixir, \texttt{RTC}, que irá criar um fecho reflexivo e
transitivo (em inglês, ``\textit{reflexive transitive closure}'') a partir de
uma relação binária $R$ e um conjunto $A$ tal que $R \subseteq A \times A$.
Para isso, precisamos definir como será a modelagem de relações binárias e
conjuntos no nosso sistema.

Para fins de simplicidade, todas as estruturas serão representadas por listas,
apesar de matematicamente não terem ordem. Portanto, o algoritmo não poderá fazer
distinção entre dois conjuntos com mesmos elementos em ordens diferentes.

Assim, decidimos utilizar uma lista de elementos para o conjunto, uma lista de
duplas ordenadas para a relação binária, e qualquer símbolo do Elixir como
elementos -- embora utilizaremos apenas átomos nos nossos testes. Por exemplo:

\begingroup
\fontsize{8pt}{12pt}\selectfont
\begin{verbatim}
relation = [{:a, :b}, {:b, :c}]
set = [:a, :b, :c]
\end{verbatim}
\endgroup

\subsubsection{Algoritmo}
A ideia que tivemos para o funcionamento do algoritmo é a de simplesmente varrer,
um a um, os elementos do conjunto $A$. Para cada elemento, varreremos a relação
de entrada, e verificaremos as tuplas onde o primeiro equivale ao elemento
iterado atualmente, verificando então os elementos atingidos a partir desse.
Para evitar loops infinitos (por exemplo, em um grafo com ciclos),
interromperemos as iterações quando retornarmos a algum valor alcançado
anteriormente. Em pseudo-código, podemos descrever isso como:

\begingroup
\fontsize{8pt}{12pt}\selectfont
\begin{verbatim}
fecho_reflexivo_transitivo(relação, conjunto):
 fecho = []
 para cada elem do conjunto:
  fecho += obter_elementos_atingidos(elem, [elem])
 retornar fecho

obter_elementos_atingidos(atual, caminho):
 resultado = []
 para cada dupla da relação:
  {x, y} = dupla
  se x == atual:
   se y está em caminho ou y não está no conjunto:
    continue
   senão:
    resultado += obter_elementos_atingidos(
      atual, caminho ++ [y])
 resultado += {caminho[0], atual}
 retornar resultado
\end{verbatim}
\endgroup

Esse código obterá todos os elementos alcançáveis para cada elemento do conjunto
e os unirá em uma única lista ``fecho'' a ser retornada. Em outras palavras,
retorna o fecho transitivo da relação. Como a lista ainda inclui \{elem, elem\}
para todos os elementos do conjunto, o fecho será também reflexivo.

Há, porém, três detalhes no código que desenvolvemos que diferem deste
pseudo-código:

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\alph{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Será utilizada recursão ao invés de iteração}.
  Isto é simples; dado que todos os elementos iterados (a relação e o conjunto)
  são listas, podemos iterar utilizando pattern matching:
\begingroup
\fontsize{8pt}{12pt}\selectfont
\begin{verbatim}
iterar(lista):
 case lista do
  [] -> []
  [head | tail] -> funcao(head) ++ iterar(tail)
   # funcao(x) retornará uma lista parcial
 end
\end{verbatim}
\endgroup
  \item \emph{Será utilizado pattern matching ao invés de condições/funções}.
  Especificamente, realizaremos as seguintes trocas:
  \begingroup
  \fontsize{8pt}{12pt}\selectfont
  \begin{verbatim}
{x, y} = dupla
se x == atual:
 ...
# Trocar por:
case dupla do
 {^atual, y} -> ...
end
# --------------------- #
se y está em caminho:
 ...
# Trocar por:
se contém(caminho, y):
 ...

defp contém(lista, elem) do
 case lista do
  [] -> false
  [^elem | _] -> true
  [_ | tail] -> contém(tail, elem)
 end
end
# --------------------- #
caminho[0]
# Trocar por:
primeiro(caminho)

defp primeiro(lista) do
 case lista do
   [head | _] -> head
 end
end
  \end{verbatim}
  \endgroup
  \item \emph{Queremos retornar um fecho ordenado e com elementos únicos}.
  Atualmente, como apresentado acima, o código retornará um fecho cujas duplas
  variam em ordem e quantidade de acordo com a relação de entrada. Por exemplo,
  haverá múltiplos elementos \{:a, :b\} se houver múltiplos caminhos de :a até :b;
  e a ordem das tuplas \{:a, \_\} depende da ordem delas na relação original.
  Além disso, a ordem do conjunto modifica também quais conjuntos de duplas 
  aparecem primeiro. Para minimizar os efeitos que a ordem da relação e do
  conjunto impõe, o resultado final será ordenado e terá duplicatas removidas.
  Existem funções para isso na biblioteca padrão do Elixir, mas desejamos
  garantir o uso de recursão. Para isso, criamos duas funções auxiliares simples,
  unique() e sort(), sobre as quais o resultado final será aplicado antes de
  ser retornado ao usuário. Assim, o resultado do fecho reflexivo transitivo
  será previsível.
\end{enumerate}

Desta forma, aprofundando-se sobre o pseudo-código e com a sintaxe do Elixir,
criamos a função \texttt{RTC.of(relação, conjunto)}, que realiza o fecho
reflexivo transitivo da relação sobre o conjunto.

\subsubsection{Testes}
Criamos os casos de teste do nosso programa, com entradas e saídas esperadas.
A ideia é cobrir o máximo de condições de borda para verificar o funcionamento
total do nosso módulo. Sendo assim, definimos as seguintes propriedades para
várias entradas:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Relação ou conjunto vazio}.
  Para relação vazia, será retornado o fecho simétrico sobre o conjunto. Para
  conjunto vazio, o fecho será sempre vazio.
  \item \emph{Dupla da relação com elemento fora do conjunto}.
  Se o elemento estiver do lado esquerdo da dupla, não iteraremos sobre o
  elemento nunca. Se estiver do lado direito, precisamos ignorar esta dupla.
  \item \emph{Ciclos na relação}.
  Este caso pode gerar loops infinitos, então verificaremos que ele roda.
  \item \emph{Múltiplos caminhos a um mesmo elemento}.
  O caso em que podemos chegar a um único elemento por múltiplos caminhos
  pode gerar elementos duplicados.
  \item \emph{Grafos de relação desconexos}.
  Deve gerar o mesmo valor de duas chamadas desconexas do fecho.
  \item \emph{Relação já reflexiva/transitiva}.
  A reflexividade/transitividade não pode ser perdida.
  \item \emph{Elemento inalcançável por outro}.
  Não haverá transitividade do segundo elemento ao primeiro.
  \item \emph{Um único elemento no conjunto}.
  O fecho será a bijeção do elemento sobre ele mesmo.
  \item \emph{Tipos diferentes de elementos no conjunto}.
  A única coisa que levará os tipos em consideração é a ordenação no final.
  Tirando isso, o valor dos elementos não possui importância.
\end{itemize}

Construímos os testes tentando cobrir estas propriedades e outros casos que nos
ocorreram, de relações sem condições de borda.


\section{Resultados}
Ao término desse exercício programa, conseguimos desenvolver um algoritmo de
fecho reflexivo e transitivo, em \texttt{rtc/lib/rtc.ex}. Os casos de teste foram
criados no arquivo \texttt{rtc/test/rtc\_test.exs}, e preveem várias situações
as quais o programa responderá. Executando o comando \texttt{mix test} na pasta
\texttt{rtc}, todos os testes passaram, corroborando o correto funcionamento do
programa.


\section{Conclusão}
Esse exercício programa nos permitiu exercitar conceitos importantes de matemática
discreta. Usamos a definição de relações transitivas e reflexivas para criar o
algoritmo para calcular o fecho. A linguagem Elixir foi uma ótima ferramenta
para essa tarefa. Ela nos deu ferramentas de programação funcional 
(\textit{pattern matting}, recursão) que foram adequadas para a resolução
do problema. Aprendemos muito sobre programação funcional com esse exercício.
O novo paradigma nos forçou a abandonar estruturas de programação como \textit{loop} e
variáveis mutáveis, que são bastante comuns em linguagem imperativas. No lugar delas,
pensamos em recursão e imutabilidade. Esse aprendizado será valioso para
projetos futuros.




% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
